							When asked the question “what are games fundamentally about?” non-gamers often deliver the old, tired phrase about games being just a power fantasy in some form or another. This is, to a limited extent, actually true. While acting as mediums for power fantasies holds no fault on it’s own, these people may fail to see the other elements games have to offer. Games cater to such a wide selection of interests, desires and motives, that it would be ignorant to try to fit them all under a single label. Curiosity and exploration, testing one’s own ingenuity, safely experiencing woeful and possibly dangerous events, the social aspects of multiplayer gaming, and having a sense of agency are but a few examples of non-power fantasy related experiences games can offer.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							Agency is about control. It’s about having a feeling that your choices matter and that you’ve made an impact on the situation at hand. Perhaps both of these are true. It is also fundamentally different from the kind of power that people tend to think of in the context of games. Power often comes from advancing your skills, available resources and tools, often with the intent of using them to exert control over others. Power often comes from advancing and enhancing yourself, your skills, utilities and available tools compared to others. and often with the intent using said power to exert control over arising situations or characters. While power may be external or internal, it’s function is to drive the player towards their goal. On the other hand, agency is inherently internal and wholly subjective. In games it is one of the main factors in retaining the player’s continued interest.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							Agency derives itself from several sources. One of the main ways of introducing agency to the player is by offering meaningful choices, or at least the illusion of a meaningful choice. In a game’s context a choice is defined as any moment in play where the player could perform two or more distinct, mutually exclusive actions that result in a distinct outcome. For a choice to be meaningful, there are a few criterias it should fulfill in most cases.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							To be meaningful, the choice must not be arbitrary. The player has to understand the choice they’re making. To properly understand the choice, the game must have a system that allows the player to weigh their options . This doesn’t mean the player has to fully understand the consequences of their choice. Rather, the player should feel like they have enough knowledge to judge the situation as deeply as necessary and not feel cheated.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							Secondly, for the choice to be meaningful, the player has to believe that their choice leads to its own distinct result. Moot “choices” that clearly lead to the same result rob the player of agency. It gives the player the feeling that anyone could have done the same, or that the action could just as well have been performed by an automaton. Also, if the game lets the player do everything without excluding some courses of action, the experience is diluted. For a choice to be engaging, it has to impact the game, and by affecting the game, it may in turn affect the player.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							The third important point is that a choice is not a calculation. If there is a definitive right answer or action that the player has to execute in a given situation, despite other options being available, the choice loses its meaning. In that case the player is simply going through the motions in order to ideally complete the situation. For example, if a game in which the player advances a character in gear and abilities had an easily calculable solution as the definitive “best build”,  the whole point of personal customization is thrown right out the window, as the player is punished for not selecting exactly optimal equipment and abilities. Thus for choices to matter, multiple paths must be considered viable and interesting.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							Choice is prevalent in games, but not in other forms of media. Why? Simply because it can exist. The most fundamental way in which games differentiate themselves from other media is interactivity, which is closely tied to the promise of agency. No other media is capable of this. Naturally interactivity is not required to deliver an engaging experience, which can be found in literature, film and music, but it is necessary in order to forge a certain variety of experience. Being able to influence the work and interact with the game’s world allows us to explore a unique side of the human condition. Instead of interpreting choices of others, the player is making their own choices, creating and applying their own solutions for their own personal reasons. By not being limited to analyzing and speculating, for example, a literary character’s actions, but rather seizing the moment controlled by your own intellect and emotions, a unique narrative is born. This allows the player to feel involved and significant in the context of the game’s world, which is a deeply rooted human desire.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							It has been widely proven that humans have a notoriously unrealistic view of agency in their own lives. While countless external factors limit the amount of control we’re able exert on our everyday lives while living in accordance with common cultural norms, we continue believing that we’re in complete control of our lives. Even situations that we are powerless to influence, our brain tricks us into believing we had some small role to play in its outcome. To complicate things, we often find ourselves doing something without a reason, and only retrospectively assign a motive to our actions.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							Games on the other hand are intentionally designed with player agency in mind. Their worlds are constructed to abide by certain rules, which are deliberate, finite and specific to that game in particular. The player is then free to explore the boundaries of the system and its laws, to explore the mechanics that govern the world and how actions and objects interact. The game will then provide the player with an immediate and, to a certain extent, surmisable response. This engagement, this ability to exert one’s influence and to feel to have affected the world is immensely powerful and something that all humans desire. This is also where a significant part of a game’s satisfaction comes from. The need to matter and be significant in some way is so powerful that if lacking any real control, our minds may come up with superstitions and faulty logical connections between events. This is an area in which games may prove to be of use.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							In a game almost everything is done with a purpose, even if that purpose was to fool around. Our actions are deliberate and we might have a vague idea of what the consequences of those actions are. This logic can be applied to the real world. By highlighting people’s mindsets while playing a game and encouraging that kind of goal oriented behaviour, it is possible to help people reclaim the sense of agency in their own lives.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							From a psychological standpoint games and game design offer an interesting field of research. From designing games with the intent of supporting a child’s mental development, virtual reality goggles being used in certain therapies, and helping people to feel in control of their lives, the future holds a whole spectrum of possible uses for games.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							Player agency is the unsung element in the heart of game design, and one of the most compelling reasons that invigorates the player and invites them back to the game world. Being offered a pallette of meaningful choices in an interactive environment is something unique to games, as it is impossible achieve in more traditional media. Taking actions and making meaningful choices allows the player to  identify as their game avatars, and are immersed in the game’s world in an entirely different way one would be immersed in a book. You won’t hear a player say “Mario beat the level”, but rather “I beat the level.” This aspect of game design is by no means fully explored and the future hold many exciting possibilities.
