						<p>
							Field &amp; Cabins Productions was formed by Mikko Peltola and Tuomas Hyttinen in October 2015 with the goal of creating a game for a school assignment. With only a rudimentary grasp on programming we started out learning C# and object-oriented programming from scratch in order to create our project. Towards the end we incorporated the Unity engine to the game for UI and audio elements.
						<p/>
						<br />
						<p>
							The road was long and rocky and several mistakes were made, but in the end our team managed to create what we set out to make.. sort of. We had to cut about 60% of our initially planned features and roughly 80% of out story content due to time limits and the really convoluted game engine we built.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							All in all our project was a success, and if nothing more, at least we gained some newfound respect for game developers. Through our hardship and agonizing trial and error we realized even a seemingly small thing in-game can take a really long time to make.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							All in all the whole project was meant to introduce us to C#, OOP and the process of making games. In that it succeeded with flying colors. We both found programming really enjoyable and quite addictive. Given our experience and newly learned skills we're ready to jump on to an all new project.
